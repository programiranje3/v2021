"""
TASK 1:
Write a function that receives two lists and returns a new list that contains 
only those elements (without duplicates) that appear in both input lists.
"""
# def common_elements(l1, l2):


"""
TASK 2:
Write a function that receives 2 lists of the same length and returns a new list 
obtained by concatenating the two input lists index-wise. Example:
Input lists:
list1 = ["M", "na", "i", "Ke"]
list2 = ["y", "me", "s", "lly"]
Output: ['My', 'name', 'is', 'Kelly']
"""
# def concat_index_wise(l1, l2):


""" 
TASK 3:
Write a function that checks and returns whether a given string is a pangram or not.
Pangrams are sentences or phrases containing every letter of the alphabet at least once 
(for example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")

Hint: ascii_lowercase from the string module can be used to get all letters
"""
# def pangram(string):


"""
TASK 4:
Write a function that receives a string with a mix of lower and upper case letters.
The function arranges letters in such a way that all lowercase letters come first,
followed by all upper case letters. Non-letter characters (if any) are ignored, that is,
not included in the new 're-arranged' string.
The new,'re-arranged' string is the function's return value.
"""
# def rearrange_string(string):


"""
TASK 5:
Write a function that accepts a sequence of comma separated passwords and
checks their validity using the following criteria:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z] => At least 1 lower case letter
2. At least 1 number between [0-9] => At least 1 digit
3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z] => At least 1 upper case letter
4. At least 1 of these characters: $,#,@
5. Length in the 6-12 range (including 6 and 12)
Passwords that match the criteria should be printed in one line separated by a comma.
"""
# def password_check(passwords):


"""
TASK 6:
Write a function that receives a report (as a string) on the state (up / down) of several servers.
Each line of the report refers to one server, and has the following format:
"Server <server_name> is <up/down>"
Note that some lines may be empty.
The function should process the report and print:
- the total number of servers mentioned in the report
- the proportion of servers that are down
- names of servers that are down (if any)
"""
# def server_status(report):


"""
TASK 7:
Write a function that finds numbers between 100 and 400 (both included)
where each digit of a number is even. The numbers that match this criterion
should be printed as a comma-separated sequence.
